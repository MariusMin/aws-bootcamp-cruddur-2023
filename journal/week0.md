# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
## Adding explanation how this week went.

## I have learned a lot of new tools. Watched all of the pre-requisite vidoes. It was quite hard not having all the basics. Should have spend more time during the official start

### Installing AWS CLI

I did watch the whole video quite some time without actually completing it to the end. At some point I always did something wrong and incomplete and it actually took me some time to figure and complete it. I did do it via gitpod so after watching the Updating Your Journal in Gitpod I understood that for this part i do not have to provide proof.
